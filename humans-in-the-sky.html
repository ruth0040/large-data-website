            <p>Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot
              or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather
              phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere.
              Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation
              activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric
              conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification,
              "weather" is understood to be the weather of Earth.</p>

          <h2><strong>Air Pollution</strong></h2>
          <div class="main-article">
            <p>Not actual content on air pollution. They can be
              small and cute, or they can be dark grey and menacing. In this article
              we will learn about what clouds are.</p>

            <p>A cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or
              frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the
              atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body, such as the earth.
              These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied
              in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

            <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air
              in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two
              processes; cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient
              saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga,
              which evaporates before reaching the surface.</p>

            <p>Clouds in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer
              closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names due to the universaal
              adaptation of Luke Howard's nomenclature. It was introduced in December
              1802 and became the basis of the modern classification system. Synoptic
              surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report any
              type of tropospheric cloud visible at scheduled observation times based
              on its height and physical appearance.</p>

            <p>While a majority of clouds form in Earth's troposphere,
              there are occasions when they can be observed at much higher altitudes
              in the stratosphere and mesosphere. These three main atmospheric layers
              are collectively known as the homosphere. Above this lies the thermosphere
              and exosphere, which together make up the heterosphere that marks the
              transition to outer space. Clouds have been observed on other planets
              and moons within the Solar System, but, due to their different temperature
              characteristics, they are composed of other substances such as methane,
              ammonia, and sulfuric acid.</p>

            <p>Not actual content on Smog it has gotten
              you soaked. Maybe it makes you feel dull and dreary, or maybe it makes
              you feel happy, however it makes you feel this is how it happens.</p>

            <p>Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from
              atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated—that is, become heavy
              enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water
              cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the
              Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystem,
              as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.</p>

            <p>The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional
              zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts.
              If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls
              from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such
              as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands.
              In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is
              maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces
              moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains.
              On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry
              air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass.
              The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings
              rainy seasons to savannah climes.</p>

            <p>The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in
              amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also
              causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including
              wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in
              the tropics.[citation needed] Antarctica is the driest continent. The
              globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 millimetres
              (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 millimetres
              (39 in). Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate
              classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate
              between differing climate regimes. Rainfall is measured using rain gauges.
              Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.</p>

            <p>Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be
              composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid or even iron rather than water.</p>

            <p>Not actual content on Flying, sending little
              or big rock sized chunks of ice falling toward the earth. Hail can
              cause serious damage and if you get caught out in a hail storm it
              could be really painful.</p>

            <p>Hail is a form of solid precipitation. It consists of balls or irregular
              lumps of ice, each of which is called a hailstone. Unlike graupel,
              which is made of rime, and ice pellets, which are smaller and translucent,
              hailstones consist mostly of water ice and measure between 5 and 15
              centimetres (2 and 6 in) in diameter. The METAR reporting code for
              hail 5 mm (0.20 in) or greater is GR, while smaller hailstones and
              graupel are coded GS. Hail is possible within most thunderstorms as
              it is produced by cumulonimbi, and within 2 nautical miles (3.7 km)
              of the parent storm. Hail formation requires environments of strong,
              upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm (similar to tornadoes) and
              lowered heights of the freezing level. In the mid-latitudes, hail forms
              near the interiors of continents, while in the tropics, it tends to
              be confined to high elevations.</p>

            <p>There are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms
              using weather satellites and weather radar imagery. Hailstones generally
              fall at higher speeds as they grow in size, though complicating factors
              such as melting, friction with air, wind, and interaction with rain
              and other hailstones can slow their descent through Earth's atmosphere.
              Severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a
              damaging size, as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures
              and, most commonly, farmers' crops.</p>

            <p>Hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds, particularly those with
              intense updrafts, high liquid water content, great vertical extent,
              large water droplets, and where a good portion of the cloud layer
              is below freezing 0 °C (32 °F). These types of strong updrafts
              can also indicate the presence of a tornado. The growth rate is
              maximized where air is near a temperature of −13 °C (9 °F)</p>
