  - Is smog part of the weather?
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
  - Yes they both struggled with where to put travel/flight
  - What to call the sections with the effects in it, like aurura borealis
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
  - Ye for the most part the groupings were very similar
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
  - Yes I didn't expect flight to be grouped with the effects
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
  - Yes, they were very similar to my expectations, the only thing was the flight topic
  seemed to be the one lone topic that got thrown some where.
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
  - I felt slightly bad because some of the topics seemed to frustrate the card sorters,
  as well as some of the over head topics seemed to stump them as well.
