## Hail

Hail is a form of solid precipitation. It consists of balls or irregular lumps
of ice, each of which is called a hailstone. Unlike graupel, which is made of
rime, and ice pellets, which are smaller and translucent, hailstones – on Earth –
consist mostly of water ice and measure between 5 millimetres (0.20 in) and 15
centimetres (6 in) in diameter. The METAR reporting code for hail 5 mm (0.20 in)
or greater is GR, while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded GS. Hail is
possible within most thunderstorms as it is produced by cumulonimbi, and within
2 nautical miles (3.7 km) of the parent storm. Hail formation requires environments
of strong, upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm (similar to tornadoes)
and lowered heights of the freezing level. In the mid-latitudes, hail forms near
the interiors of continents, while in the tropics, it tends to be confined to high elevations.

There are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using weather
satellites and weather radar imagery. Hailstones generally fall at higher speeds
as they grow in size, though complicating factors such as melting, friction with
air, wind, and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent
through Earth's atmosphere. Severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the
stones reach a damaging size, as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures
and, most commonly, farmers' crops.

###Definition

Any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm.
 Hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres (0.20 in) or more. Hailstones can grow to
 15 centimetres (6 in) and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms (1.1 lb).

Unlike ice pellets, hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together.
Hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and
translucent ice at least 1 millimetre (0.039 in) thick, which are deposited upon
the hailstone as it travels through the cloud, suspended aloft by air with strong
upward motion until its weight overcomes the updraft and falls to the ground.
Although the diameter of hail is varied, in the United States, the average
observation of damaging hail is between 2.5 cm (1 in) and golf ball-sized (1.75 in).

Stones larger than 2 cm (0.80 in) are usually considered large enough to cause damage.
The Meteorological Service of Canada will issue severe thunderstorm warnings when
hail that size or above is expected. The US National Weather Service has a 2.5 cm
(1 in) or greater in diameter threshold, effective January 2010, an increase over
the previous threshold of ¾-inch hail. Other countries will have different
thresholds according local sensitivity to hail; for instance grape growing areas
could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones. Hailstones can be very large
or very small, depending on how strong the updraft is: weaker hailstorms produce
smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms (such as supercells).

### Formation

Hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds, particularly those with intense updrafts,
high liquid water content, great vertical extent, large water droplets, and where
a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0 °C (32 °F). These types
of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado. The growth
rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of −13 °C (9 °F)
