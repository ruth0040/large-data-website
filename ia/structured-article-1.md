The sky, also known as the celestial dome, commonly refers to everything that l
ies a certain distance above the surface of Earth, including the atmosphere and
the rest of outer space. In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the
celestial sphere. This is an imaginary dome where the sun, stars, planets, and
the moon are seen to be traveling. The celestial sphere is divided into regions
called constellations. Usually, the term sky is used from the point of view of
the Earth's surface; however, the exact meaning of the term can vary. For example,
in some cases the sky is defined as only the denser portions of the atmosphere.
