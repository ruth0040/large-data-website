## Smog

Smog is a type of air pollution; the word *smog* was made in the early 20th
century as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog. The
word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a
familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid 20th century.
This kind of smog is caused by the burning of large amounts of coal within a city;
this smog contains soot particulates from smoke, sulfur dioxide and other components.
Modern smog, as found for example in Los Angeles, is a type of air pollution derived
from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that
react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine
with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. The atmospheric pollution
levels of Los Angeles, Mexico City and other cities are increased by inversion that
traps pollution close to the ground.

###Etymology

Coinage of the term *smog* is generally attributed to Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux
in his 1905 paper, *Fog and Smoke* for a meeting of the Public Health Congress.
The July 26, 1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux,
"He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great
cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was
known as *smog.*" The following day the newspaper stated that "Dr. Des Voeux
did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog." *Smog* also appears
in a January 19, 1893, *Los Angeles Times* article and is attributed to "a witty
English writer."

###Photochemical smog

Photochemical smog was first described in the 1950s. It is the chemical reaction
of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere,
which leaves airborne particles and ground-level ozone. This noxious mixture
of air pollutants can include the following:

- Aldehydes
- Nitrogen oxides, such as nitrogen dioxide
- Peroxyacyl nitrates
- Tropospheric ozone
- Volatile organic compounds

All of these chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical
smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is
present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm,
dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the
wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.
