# The Marvelous Sky

The sky, an item that many people take for granted. Everyone has been exposed to
the sky and its amazing and vast beauty. It is the air that we breath and the back
drop for many photos, but what do people really know about the sky?

*Why is the sky blue?* is a very popular question but how many people actually know the answer?

## Purpose

This project is a school assignment, while making this site I would like to learn
 about large data biased websites and how to design a system for a large website.
 I am excited to be using Git and GitHub to complete this assignment.

I would like to explore the beauty of the sky, while I create this website.
