          <h1><strong>Beautiful Clouds</strong></h1>
          <div class="main-article">
            <p>Clouds can be big white and fluffy. They can be
              small and cute, or they can be dark grey and menacing. In this article
              we will learn about what clouds are.</p>

            <p>A cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or
              frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the
              atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body, such as the earth.
              These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied
              in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

            <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air
              in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two
              processes; cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient
              saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga,
              which evaporates before reaching the surface.</p>

            <p>Clouds in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer
              closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names due to the universaal
              adaptation of Luke Howard's nomenclature. It was introduced in December
              1802 and became the basis of the modern classification system. Synoptic
              surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report any
              type of tropospheric cloud visible at scheduled observation times based
              on its height and physical appearance.</p>

            <p>While a majority of clouds form in Earth's troposphere,
              there are occasions when they can be observed at much higher altitudes
              in the stratosphere and mesosphere. These three main atmospheric layers
              are collectively known as the homosphere. Above this lies the thermosphere
              and exosphere, which together make up the heterosphere that marks the
              transition to outer space. Clouds have been observed on other planets
              and moons within the Solar System, but, due to their different temperature
              characteristics, they are composed of other substances such as methane,
              ammonia, and sulfuric acid.</p>
